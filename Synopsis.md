# Concept #

**musicbrainzws2-java** make query the MusicBrainz server as easy as:

```

artist.search("pink floyd");```

and

```

artist.getComplete(Id);```

We could stop here, but more, you could gain full controll on the type and amount of data each call will ask for, just setting some additional parameters like:

```

artist.Include.Releases(false);
artist.Include.Aliases(true);
and
artist.setLimit(100);
artist.setMinScore(40);```

You could search releases that match the CD in your drive:
```

releases = release.lookUp("D:");```

or a given tracklist, a toc descriptor or a discId:

```

releases = release.lookUp(tracklist);
releases = release.lookUp(toc);
releases = release.lookUp(discId);```

If you have a [Musicbrainz account](http://musicbrainz.org/register), you could store your release collections, rate your favourites Artist, Releases, Recordings, Works and Labels or add some tag to them:

```

release.addTags("tag1","tag2");
artist.rate(4);
collection.addRelease(releaseId1);
or
collection.removeReleases(releaseId);```

**DISCLAIMER**

The above is not realy the actual sintax, but is not so far, keep on reading!

## Controllers ##

In normal circumstance your application needs to operate with just five
'major' classes, mamed controllers:

```

Label, Artist, ReleaseGroup, Release, Recording, Work```

They are in charge to convert your requests in as few web service call as possible, hiding all the HTTP, XML, Encoding/Decoding and other stuff you don't need to worry about.

Calls to controllers methods could result in:

## Entities ##

The mains 'data store'. Contains all the data loaded by one or more requests to the relative controller

The Entity name convention is:

```

EntityName = ControllerName+Ws2 (es. ArtistWs2).```

## Search results ##

The members of Lists returned by controllers search method, are essentially composed by the corresponding Entity and the score.

Score is the â€˜relevance degree' that the  MusicBrainz server gives to results, according to the Query clause submitted.

You could use score for filter and sort results.

The SearchResult name convention is:

```

SearchResult = ControllerName+Result+Ws2 (es. ArtistResultWs2).```
