## TO DO ##

According to [Musicbrainz XML Webservice Version 2 documentation](http://musicbrainz.org/doc/XML_Web_Service/Version_2) we could add some features:

  * [PUID](http://musicbrainz.org/doc/XML_Web_Service/Version_2#PUID_submission), [ISRC](http://musicbrainz.org/doc/XML_Web_Service/Version_2#ISRC_submission) and [BARCODE](http://musicbrainz.org/doc/XML_Web_Service/Version_2#Barcode_submission) submission.


We also need to refine documentation.

We are working on it, but no timeline is defined.
Any Help is appreciated.
